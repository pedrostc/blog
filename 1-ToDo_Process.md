# My ToDo Process
## Motivaton
The main motivation behind this process was to answer some questions:
- WTF did I do today?
- Why haven't I finished tasks X, Y and Z?
- Why I can't move forward with this task?
And also to help to break huge tasks into smaller ones and keeping note of the evolution of this process throughout time (Ex.:  Task 1 was too big so it became 10 separate tasks with sub tasks during it's 4 days of necessary work.)
It had the good side effect of giving me a knowledge base on the project that I was working on at the moment and have notes organized with the tasks that originated them.

## Why not use X tool?
I've tried many tools, but none of them gave me all that I wanted, and their process didn't match what I wanted.
Also it was an exercise on the "Process first" approach, trying to learn how to use a tool and the process that it was built to fulfil is too much overhead and normally leads to just abandoning everything.
Using regular, simple todo list apps ended up like a huge mess, so I decide to move one step back and just do a simple list using index cards and pens of different colors.
Recently I'm giving Microsof ToDo a try, and so far I really like how it organizes eveything and the integration with Outlook. There are some things that I wish it had, like being able to see the history of a task, add notes to specific sub-tasks (now you can only add notes to the task but not to specific subitems, and be able to see the previous versions of "My Day", like "My Yesterday" or something like that.

## Tools needed
- Index cards.
- Pens of different colors. The basic set of one blue, one black, and one red is perfect and is all I use.
- Somewhere to hang the cards so they stay into view and easy to access.
- Something to group all the past cards. I use Binder Clips for this, and also to hang the cards.

## The process

        I use indentation and different bullets to show hierarchy
            - [] Item 1
 + [] sub item 1.1
 + [] sub item 1.2
- [] Item 2
- [] Item 3
            I borrowed this notation from markdown
            Yes I use markdown notation while hand-writing something.
        I normally keep the list depth to 2 levels (main item and sub items)
        At the top of the card I have the name of the project (the thing that I use to group the lists) and the date.
        All items are written down using a BLUE pen
        The tasks checkboxes have different symbols and colors for different actions
            - [X] Done Item
- [-] Cancelled Item
- [+] Not completed Item moved to the next day.
            "Done" is BLACK.
            "Cancelled" and "Moved to the next day" are RED.
        "Done" and "Cancelled" Items are crossed over.
        "Not Done" Items have a count at the end of how many days they're on the list. This counter is in RED
        I normally add notes to items. The notes are written on the back of the card and I use symbols appended to the end of the item description to link to the note on the back.
        I always keep the order of the items, This helps to quickly see which are new and which are older.
        If I need to add a new sub-item to an item, but its sub-items list was interrupted (because there's more items on the list) I use a mark appended to the end of the item description and add the subitem to the marker on the next available line.
            - [] item 1 *
 + [] sub-item 1.1
- [] item 2
- [] item 3
* + [] sub-item 1.2
        At the end of the day, while creating next day's list I move all not completed sub-items together.
            - [] item 1
 + [] sub-item 1.1
 + [] sub-item 1.2
- [] item 2
- [] item 3
        Most of these rules are due to the paper and ink be immutable, but also it has the nice side-effect of showing how the day evolved.
        There's a tendency to work from the bottom of the list up. This is normally due to very large and general items being broken down into smaller and more specific items that go to the bottom of the list
            This is not a hard rule, just something that happens sometimes. Other times I work normally and the bottom of my list is basically a mind dump of ideas and questions that are taking space in my head.
        It's ok to work on tasks that were not originally on the list, but it would be great to add them to the list ASAP.
