The Original process
    Motivaton
        The main motivation to create my own todo process was to answer some questions
            WTF did I do today?
            Why haven't I finished tasks X, Y and Z?
            Why I can't move forward with this task?
        And also to help to break huge tasks into smaller ones and keeping note of the evolution of this process throughout time.
            Task 1 was too big so it became 10 separate tasks with sub tasks during it's 4 days of necessary work.
        It had the good side effect of giving me a knowledge base on the project that I was working on at the moment and have notes organized with the tasks that originated them.
    Why not use a tool?
        I tried many tools, but none of them gave me all that I wanted and their process didn't match my needs.
        Also it was an exercise of the "Process first" approach.
            This is an idea that I revisit every now and then and it's based on my own frustrations growing as a developer and observing some failing projects and implementations.
            There's a tendency to find the right tool to the job without knowing what the job is.
            Throwing the responsibility of fixing the process on the tool of choice instead of trying to learn a methodology first and then finding a tool that's right to it.
            It most certainly not my original idea, there are probably a ton of articles out there about it but I don't know how they call it. (Process First, Technology second?)
            Also, trying to learn how to use a tool and it's process is too much overhead and normally lead to just abandoning everything.
    The process
        I use indentation and different bullets to show hierarchy
            - [] Item 1
 + [] sub item 1.1
 + [] sub item 1.2
- [] Item 2
- [] Item 3
            I borrowed this notation from markdown
            Yes I use markdown notation while hand-writing something.
        I normally keep the list depth to 2 levels (main item and sub items)
        At the top of the card I have the name of the project (the thing that I use to group the lists) and the date.
        All items are written down using a BLUE pen
        The tasks checkboxes have different symbols and colors for different actions
            - [X] Done Item
- [-] Cancelled Item
- [+] Not completed Item moved to the next day.
            "Done" is BLACK.
            "Cancelled" and "Moved to the next day" are RED.
        "Done" and "Cancelled" Items are crossed over.
        "Not Done" Items have a count at the end of how many days they're on the list. This counter is in RED
        I normally add notes to items. The notes are written on the back of the card and I use symbols appended to the end of the item description to link to the note on the back.
        I always keep the order of the items, This helps to quickly see which are new and which are older.
        If I need to add a new sub-item to an item, but its sub-items list was interrupted (because there's more items on the list) I use a mark appended to the end of the item description and add the subitem to the marker on the next available line.
            - [] item 1 *
 + [] sub-item 1.1
- [] item 2
- [] item 3
* + [] sub-item 1.2
        At the end of the day, while creating next day's list I move all not completed sub-items together.
            - [] item 1
 + [] sub-item 1.1
 + [] sub-item 1.2
- [] item 2
- [] item 3
        Most of these rules are due to the paper and ink be immutable, but also it has the nice side-effect of showing how the day evolved.
        There's a tendency to work from the bottom of the list up. This is normally due to very large and general items being broken down into smaller and more specific items that go to the bottom of the list
            This is not a hard rule, just something that happens sometimes. Other times I work normally and the bottom of my list is basically a mind dump of ideas and questions that are taking space in my head.
        It's ok to work on tasks that were not originally on the list, but it would be great to add them to the list ASAP.
