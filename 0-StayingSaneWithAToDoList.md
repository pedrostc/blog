# Staying sane with a ToDo list.

During my life as a developer I learned a lot about a lot of things. One of my most recent and important lesson was how to better manage my to do list and how to not use it to create blame and stress, but instead to help me accomplish my objectives.
I thought at first that I had a problem with to do lists, after a while I figured that I had a problem with the items on the list. This change in perspective helped me to find a process to better handle my tasks and better manage my time.

## Lesson 1: Break down items into their smallest components.

My first problem is items that way to general and don't represent the whole work necessary to complete them. I refer to it as the "it's just" effect. We've all being there: "It's just a button" or "It's just a small change." Tasks on the list that reflect this vibe would severely hurt my productivity after a while. "Why am I working on this one item for 2 days?" That kind line of thought can be devastating for the morale in a very unfair way (well, assuming that you are actually doing the necessary work), and also can create a lot of inertia.
Instead of just at look at the big item and wonder how to start, or why is it still on the list, replace it with a series of smaller tasks that you need to complete the whole job. You probably do it anyways, but may not take note of it. Just put those steps on the list, replacing or underneath the original big item and feel the pleasure of see the list actually becoming smaller while you cross each item from it.

## Lesson 2: Add questions, thoughts, doubts, and random thoughts to the bottom of the list.

Random thoughts always occur and that's just ok. But if you see yourself letting your focus drift from the task at hand to figure something out, that's something that should go to the list. Also, unless it's necessary to solve the task at hand, it should be resolved after you're done with the current task.
I started doing this to every single random thought that would appear in my head and it ended-up being a good exercise for my focus. Not just the amount of random things reduced a bit, but also keeping the focus and dismissing them became way easier.

## Lesson 3: Write everything down.

This may seem obvious after the last two items. Write everything that you is doing, will do, or did to the list. There's no big or small thing that should be off of the list. This helped me to keep track of my interruptions, questions, random stops for research and what not. Also everytime I have to research something or answer a question I take not of the solution somewhere on the list, so the answer is close to the question.
I do not track time for all the tasks, that just adds another overhead to the process, but I'm aware that I needed to research how to solve a very specific thing, and dig deeper on the code to verify how something works. By the end of the day I don't have the feeling of not accomplishing anything, I can see that actually I accomplished a lot of things that needed to be done. And if most of the things were not necessary to my work I can see what rabbit hole I entered and learn my lessons right.

## Lesson 4: Start every day with a new list.

A list with a lot of done items is a poluted and hard to read one. On very productive days you can end-up with a huge list full of small tasks that you finished, and that's awesome. What's not awesome is comming back on the next day and try to find the important pending items on the list and decide where to start.
I make a new, clean list for every day that I'm working on something. That's a nice starter for the workday (mainly if you do the list review that I'll talk about on the next lesson), and have the nice side-effect of giving you a history of everything that you've done in the project, which can be even better if you add notes and answers to your question on the lists. You start to build a knowledge base of sorts and that can help not just remembering something but also for documentation purposes.

## Lesson 5: Always review your lists.

After the end of the day, or before starting the next day take some time to review your last list. Check all the tasks that you've completed, all that you still need to do, the questions, challenges and blockers that appeared mid process. This helps keeping the lessons learned fresh on your memory and also gives you the context you need to continue what you were doing.
I've found out that doing this review first thing in the morning helped me to start moving faster than when I do the review by the end of the last day, but that's not set on stone. This is also a great help for stand-ups.
The result of the review should be a new list with all the things that you still need to do.
