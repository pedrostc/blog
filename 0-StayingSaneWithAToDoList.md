# Staying sane with a ToDo list.

During my life as a developer, I learned a lot about a lot of things. One of my most recent and essential lessons was how to manage my to-do list better and how not to use it to create blame and stress, but instead to help me accomplish my objectives.
I thought at first that I had a problem with to-do lists, after a while I figured that I had a problem with the items on the list. This change in perspective helped me to find a process to better handle my tasks and better manage my time.

## Lesson 1: Process first

If there's one thing that I would like you to keep from this article is this first lesson. FOCUS ON YOUR PROCESS FIRST, NOT ON THE TOOLS. I've seen projects, people and teams failing due to them relying on using a tool instead of figuring out the process that they wanted to follow. Once you know your process and can implement it independent of any tools, you can start and look for a specialized tool if you think you need one.
I tried some to-do list apps, from the simplest to the more complex, and would always stumble on how to use them and on learning the process that they were created for. Another issue with my experience was, I didn't know what I wanted for my to-do list, what I was trying to achieve. When I noticed that, I abandoned all the tools and went back to pen and paper. My main focus was now to figure out what I wanted to do, and how could I work with a list to be more productive and focused.
That's when I started to figure out the rest of the "lessons" on this post. On my day-to-day work, I experimented with lots of formats and behaviours until I felt that I was getting the answers that I wanted. Now I have my process and am ready to find a tool for it if I want to.
I'm not saying that there are not valid methods and tools out there, but that you need to find the one that fits your needs and your way of doing things.

## Lesson 2: Break down items into their smallest components.

My first problem is items that way to general and doesn't represent the whole work necessary to complete them. I refer to it as the "it's just" effect. We've all being there: "It's just a button" or "It's just a small change." Tasks on the list that reflect this vibe would severely hurt my productivity after a while. "Why am I working on this one item for 2 days?" That kind of line of thought can be devastating for morale (well, assuming that you are actually doing the necessary work), and also can create a lot of inertia.
Instead of just a look at the big item and wonder how to start, or why is it still on the list, replace it with a series of smaller tasks that you need to complete the whole job. You probably do it anyway, but may not take note of it. Just put those steps on the list, replacing or underneath the original big item and feel the pleasure of seeing the list actually becoming smaller while you cross each item from it.

## Lesson 3: Add questions, thoughts, doubts, and random thoughts to the bottom of the list.

Random thoughts always occur, and that's just ok. But if you see yourself letting your focus drift from the task at hand to figure something out, that's something that should go to the list. Also, unless it's necessary to solve the task at hand, it should be resolved after you're done with the current job.
I started doing this to every single random thought that would appear in my head, and it ended up being a good exercise for my focus. Not just the amount of random things reduced a bit, but also keeping the focus and dismissing them became way more natural.

## Lesson 4: Write everything down.

This may seem obvious after the last two items. Write everything that you are doing, will do, or did to the list. There's no "too big" or "too small," everything should be on the list. This helped me to keep track of my interruptions, questions, random stops for research and whatnot. Also, every time I have to research something or answer a question, I take not of the solution somewhere on the list, so the answer is close to the issue.
I do not track time for all the tasks, that just adds another overhead to the process. Still, I'm aware that I needed to research how to solve a particular thing and dig more in-depth on the code to verify how something works. By the end of the day, I don't have the feeling of not accomplishing anything, I can see that actually, I accomplished a lot of things that needed to be done. And if most of the items were not necessary for my work, I can see what rabbit hole I entered and learn my lessons right.

## Lesson 5: Start every day with a new list.

A list with a lot of done items is polluted and hard to read. On very productive days, you can end up with a massive pile of small tasks that you finished, and that's awesome. What's not awesome is: to come back on the next day to a polluted list and try to find the critical pending items.
I make a new, clean list for every day that I'm working on something. That's an excellent starter for the workday (mainly if you do the list review that I'll talk about on the next lesson). This also has the nice side-effect of giving you a history of everything that you've done in the project. Which can be even better if you add notes and answers to your question on the lists. With that, you start to build a knowledge base of sorts, and that can help not just remembering something but also for documentation purposes.

## Lesson 6: Always review your lists.

After the end of the day or before starting the next day, take some time to review your last list. Check all the tasks that you've completed, all that you still need to do, the questions, challenges and blockers that appeared mid-process. This helps to keep the lessons learned fresh on your memory and also gives you the context you need to continue what you were doing.
I've found out that doing this review first thing in the morning helped me to start moving faster than when I do the review by the end of the last day, but that's not set on stone. This is also an excellent help for stand-ups.
The result of the review should be a new list with all the things that you still need to do.
